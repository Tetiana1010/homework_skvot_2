    <h1>Niobid</h1>
    <p style="top: 220px;">According to Greek myth, Niobe was the daughter of a city ruler Tantalus and the wife of Amphion who was the founder and ruler of Thebes. Homer wrote about her arrogance and pride in Iliad. To punish Niobe’s pride, Latona sent her two children Apollo and Artemis to kill Niobe’s fourteen children with poisonous arrows. The extreme terror drove her husband to suicide and turned Niobe into a rock. Her tragic story had inspired many artistic and literary representations through <br>the ages.</p>
